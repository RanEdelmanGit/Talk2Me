# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



Mental Health Support Platform
Project Overview
This platform is a volunteer-driven digital initiative aimed at providing free mental health support to individuals affected by recent traumatic events in Israel. The platform connects users in need of psychological support with psychology students and other volunteers who are ready to offer a listening ear and informal emotional assistance. Our mission is to help people cope with their experiences and prevent long-term psychological effects, particularly for those who may not have the financial resources to seek professional help.

Target Audience
Reservists (IDF soldiers)
Survivors of traumatic events
Victims of the events from October 7th
Concerned citizens in need of mental health support
Key Features
Free Support Platform: The service is completely free, with a primary goal to connect people who need mental health support with volunteers willing to help.
Educational Value for Volunteers: The platform provides a unique opportunity for psychology students and other supporters to gain real-world experience in interacting with individuals, improving their communication and empathy skills.
Reflection Sessions: Volunteers have access to reflection sessions with supervisors to debrief and learn from their interactions, applying these insights in future sessions and their professional careers.
Flexible Communication & Booking: Initially, the platform supports chat-based communication, allowing users to exchange information and book appointments independently. We are working to implement an integrated booking system similar to Calendly or TidyCal, enabling faster and more seamless meeting scheduling between users and volunteers.
Upcoming Features
Improved Booking System: A streamlined scheduling feature where users can request appointments with supporters directly, making it easier to manage inquiries and communication on both sides.
Volunteer-Driven Conversations: Supporters will have the option to start conversations after a user approaches or books a meeting, improving the flexibility and responsiveness of the platform.
How It Works
Sign Up: Users seeking support and volunteers willing to provide help sign up on the platform.
Connect: Users can initiate a chat with available supporters or directly request a meeting.
Book a Meeting: Soon, users will be able to book meetings using an easy-to-use booking system, where supporters can confirm or adjust their availability.
Reflection for Volunteers: After support sessions, volunteers can attend reflection sessions with supervisors to learn and grow from their experiences.
